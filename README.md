**Live Page:** https://fsolm.github.io/JS-Tic-Tac-Toe/

## Usage & Installation

To be able to run the game, you'll need either a live server extension or install the necessary *npm* packages

For the fist option, if you're using Visual Studio Code, we recommend using `Live Server` by `Litwick Rey`

For the second option, you'll need to have installed `Node.js` & be able to download npm packages. Install all npm packages in the project with the `npm i` command, and be sure to also download them globally using the `npm i -g` command. Once all the packages are installed, you can run the project locally using the `live-server` command
