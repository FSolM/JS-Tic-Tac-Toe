## Installation

All the necessary files are in the root directory, just open the HTML file.

Alternately, if you have `Node.js` installed, you can run the command `$ npm install` to add `Litwick Reys`'s `Live Server` and execute `$ live-server`. If that doesn't work, you can check its docs over [here](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server)
